# Download
The program is available for free on the [Releases tab](https://codeberg.org/ky/make-your-choice/releases). Please make sure your system supports the software. Make Your Choice supports all Windows operating systems that DbD has ever offered support for. 

## Supported Systems
- Windows 7 (SP1)
- Windows 8 & 8.1
- Windows 10
- Windows 11

Steam Deck is unsupported because SteamOS doesn't use a hosts file in the same way Windows does. Therefore, this method wouldn't function.

# UAC Popup & SmartScreen Alert
The application needs to be run with [administrator permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/user-account-control/) to ensure the hosts file can be edited. Since I don't want to pay Microsoft a fee for getting this free application signed, you will be met with a prompt to trust the unknown developer.

The UAC Popup appears on Windows Vista and newer.  
The SmartScreen Alert only appears on Windows 8 and newer.
