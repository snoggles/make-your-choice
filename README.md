# UAC Popup & SmartScreen Alert
The application needs to be run with [administrator permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/user-account-control/) to ensure the hosts file can be edited. Since I don't want to pay Microsoft a fee for getting this free application signed, you will be met with a prompt to trust the unknown developer.

The UAC Popup appears on Windows Vista and newer.  
The SmartScreen Alert only appears on Windows 8 and newer.
