# Download & Installation

## Windows
Download the latest `.exe` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/laewliet/make-your-choice/releases/latest) page and run it as administrator.

### Supported Windows Versions
- Windows 7 (SP1)
- Windows 8 & 8.1

### UAC Popup & SmartScreen Alert
The application needs to be run with [administrator permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/user-account-control/) to ensure the hosts file can be edited. Since I don't want to pay Microsoft a fee for getting this free application signed, you will be met with a prompt to trust the unknown developer.

The SmartScreen Alert only appears on Windows 8 and newer.
